[Tableau Presentation](https://tabsoft.co/3yFECXb)

## About This Project

Personal vehicle is extremely important things for Indonesian. Because of lacking public transportation, many Indonesian use their personal vehicle. In this project, we will try to analyze the second-hand market for bike and car, and then get the best action we can make regarding vehicle purchase.

## Objective

- Find the factors affecting vehicle price
- Plot the possible effect of years and milage for price depreciation
- Find interesting insight out of the data

## Workflow

- Webscrape the data from certain site
- Clean the data
- Process and analyze the data
- Make visualization in Tableau

## Discussion

For this project, I use data from the following location:

- Jakarta
- Banten
- West Java
- Central Java
- East Java
- Yogyakarta

I use data from the aforementioned location because those locations have the most vehicle listing. It is to be noted that the raw data is extremely dirty and we have to drop lots of error value because we can't exactly use the missing data, which may skews the result.

During visualization process, I need to exclude few outliers data to make the data more normal. Usually, the reason why the data may contain outliers is because faulty data is still being included in the final process.

## Results

After analyzing the data, I concluded that:

- Brio has the most car listing in the final dataset, and beat for bike counterpart
- Years have better correlation to price compared to milage
- Automatic transmission is priced higher than the manual counterpart
- Trading the vehicle even after using it may give some profit
